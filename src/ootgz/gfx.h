/* Text drawing for the menu and watches, on grids of character cells.
 *
 * The game thread fills three panels each frame and publishes them (gfx_frame):
 *   panel 0, top-left: the menu while it's open
 *   panel 1, any corner: the on-screen watches while the menu is closed
 *   panel 2, bottom-right: gz's log, the last few events, with no background, fading out
 *   panel 3, bottom-left: gz's input display, with no background
 * The render thread reads the published panels when the game presents a frame and copies
 * them into the picture (nvn.c). Until that has worked once, the menu also goes to the log. */
